### Create main_log module from test

Used the spdlog test to create an spdlog module for use in the actual app. The module can optionally take "test" as a parameter which will execute the test logging found in the original.

Learned that I don't have to, and probably shouldn't, use the `Weverything` flag when compiling with clang. Several tutorials that I have seen show the `Weverything` flag but it generates so many warnings that I can't address and suspect I don't need to, regarding compatibility that I am probably not trying to achieve.

I also learned that, in C, I have to declare functions above where they are first referenced in their respective files.
