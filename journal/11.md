### Modify database_connection compilation settings

In this commit I spent a lot of time trying to get a better working solution for compiling my database_connection module. I was able to move away from having the entire library copied into the module, which is nice, but I cannot get dynamic library linking to work without polluting the environment variables on the system. I think the only steps forward for proper bundling would be some sort of packaging abstraction or static copying and linking.
