Say hello world


Initially compiled hello world and got:
```
src/hello_world.cpp:19:2: warning: extra ';' outside of a function is incompatible with C++98
      [-Wc++98-compat-pedantic]
};
```
Turns out c++ does not want semicolons ending functions so I removed the trailing semicolon and the error was gone. Compiling with either of the following worked:
`clang++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -Weverything -lncurses src/hello_world.cpp -o legend_of_zelta`
`g++ -std=c++11 -lncurses src/hello_world.cpp -o legend_of_zelta`

The code currently prints "Hello world!" and exits on keypress.
