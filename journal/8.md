### Add a database connector module

Finally take what I've learned from compiling and the tutorial file and build a simple module on top of mysql-connector-c++ for connecting to a local DB and running a query. The code is very messy for the CMakeLists file, I intend to clean it on the next commit, in case the commented code is useful. I'm not completely sure I've gotten the parts I have correct.

One concern of mine is licensing for the mysql-connector-c++ library. I've considered rewriting it and think I could make significant enough modifications in my own style to differentiate it but I'm not sure, and that may be too much work or beyond me anyway. The documentation I could find mentions a commercial distribution but I'm not able to find any more information about it. If anyone sees this and has a recommendation please let me know. For now since the code is completely open source I should satisfy requirements, I just want to keep my options open as someone new to licensing.
