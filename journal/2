# Build 2
## Add basic spdlog test

I went with spdlog for logging because it seemed to be the most widely recommended library.

I initially had a great deal of trouble compiling it with CMake initially due to a mistake, but otherwise it seems very straightforward.

Also re-organize some of the code, put hello world in it's own directory with it's own cmake lists.
