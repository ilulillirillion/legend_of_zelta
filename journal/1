Add a CMakeLists file

Added a CMakeLists.txt file outlining the following:

`project: legend of zelta`
Specified project name.

`cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 1.0 )`
Specifies a minimum cmake version for compiling the application. In this case, 1 is arbitrary other than seeming to successfully compile the hello world file.

`find_package( Curses REQUIRED )`
`include_directories(${CURSES_INCLUDE_DIR})`
Locate and include the Curses library, used for basic graphics.

`add_executable( legend_of_zelta ./src/hello_world.cpp )`
Include all current source files.

`target_link_libraries( legend_of_zelta ${CURSES_LIBRARIES} )`
Explicitly link any external libraries (in this case, only Curses).
