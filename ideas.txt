- 'elsefire'
    lore: 
      - the fire that consumed the old mundane world and remade it with magic
      - has a literally unique, undescribable color and odor
      - as it "burns" emits whispers in an unknown language
      - moves like snakes (spreads in a similar pattern to fire)
      - side effects of witnessing the flames visually include amnesia and eldritch insanity
- all magic stems from a central networked organism (gaia theory)
