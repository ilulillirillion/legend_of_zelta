# Building
Will generate an executable file `legend_of_zelta` in project directory. Regardless of how it is built, simply execute the file to launch the game. Currently the game must be launched from a terminal or terminal emulator (there are plans to bundle a terminal emulator in the future).

## CMake (Recommended)

1. `cd` into project directory
2. `cmake .`
3. `make`
