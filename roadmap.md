# Repository
  - Dynamic README generation. Either append build journal to README automatically or fully generate a README file on build from sources.

# App Structure:
  - Use CMakeLists to build with cmake

# Code Paradigm:
  - Follow OOP for increased performance. Use FP wherever in modular components where the performance lost is sufficiently mitigated or absent altogether.

# Code Features:
  - Monads
    - optional monad
    - error handling monad
  - Expose interface for python scripting

# App
  - logger
    - togglable
    - can set levels
    - can output to multiple streams
    - can log objects
    - log function name
    - log line number
  - network
    - serve data to client
    - allow client to get data from database

# Game Objects:
  - game
  - player

# Notes:
  - use 'auto' to shorten for loops?
